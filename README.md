# LangChain Concepts & Projects

A structured collection of **concepts, examples, and projects** to learn and apply [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) — from fundamentals to building powerful AI agents and workflows.

## 🚀 What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework that helps developers build **LLM-powered applications**.  
It provides building blocks to connect **large language models (LLMs)** with external data, memory, and tools, enabling applications like:

- Question Answering over documents  
- Conversational chatbots  
- Agents with tool usage  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  

---

## 🌟 Why is LangChain Important?

Modern LLMs (like GPT, Claude, Gemini) are powerful but **limited in isolation**. They:  
- Forget context after a few turns  
- Can’t directly access external data  
- Struggle with reasoning beyond prompts  

**LangChain solves this** by:  
✅ Adding **memory** so apps remember past conversations  
✅ Integrating with **tools & APIs**  
✅ Supporting **retrievers & vector databases** for knowledge grounding  
✅ Enabling **agents** that can act dynamically  

This makes LangChain a key framework for building **real-world, production-ready AI apps**.

## 🔑 Core Concepts

1. **Chains**  
   - Sequences of calls (LLM → prompt → output) that form workflows.  
   - Example: Summarize → Translate → Answer.

2. **Prompts**  
   - Templates that structure input to LLMs.  
   - Helps reuse and standardize queries.

3. **Agents**  
   - LLMs that decide which tool/action to take next.  
   - Example: Search → Retrieve Data → Generate Answer.

4. **Tools**  
   - External functions or APIs an agent can call.  
   - E.g., Google Search, calculator, database query.

5. **Memory**  
   - Store conversation history or context.  
   - Example: A chatbot remembering past user preferences.

6. **Retrievers & Vector Stores**  
   - Fetch relevant chunks from external knowledge.  
   - Powering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
